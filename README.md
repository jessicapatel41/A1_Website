University project of a dairy website. 

SPECIFICATIONS

Background
Dunedin Dairy sells dairy products. You can go visit them in Dunedin, or you can order their products online from the comfort of your home (or beach or wherever). The shop uses a service-oriented architecture with a customer-facing UI front-end, and a service back-end

This assignment looks at the separation of data from the UI, and how such data can be consumed and used in the end-user application. A later assignment will also explore potential vulnerabilities that could arise when such an architecture is poorly implemented.

A small number of data sources that supply key information content from the shop have been identified. These data sources enable separation of information content from the presentation.

Note that the application you create here will not allow a user to buy any product. Buying products will require a user to register and authenticate. We will defer this to a later assignment.
